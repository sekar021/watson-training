Integrating your custom model with the Discovery tooling
You can integrate a Knowledge Studio custom model into the Entity Extraction or Relation Extraction enrichments with the Discovery tooling.

Get the Model ID of your Knowledge Studio model.
In the Discovery tooling, click the Manage Data icon on the upper left to open the Manage data screen, then create or open a collection. Note: If you choose an existing collection, it should be empty. If not, you should reingest those documents after creating your new configuration file.
In the Configuration section of the Manage Data screen for your collection, click Switch, then Create a New Configuration. Name the configuration.
Click Add enrichments and select either the Entity Extraction or Relation Extraction enrichments.
Enter the Model ID in the Custom Model ID box of the selected enrichment. The custom IBM Watson™ Knowledge Studio model will override the default for that enrichment.
Click Apply, then Done.
